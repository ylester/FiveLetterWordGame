# Five Letter Word Game
In the 5 Letter word game, you have to guess what the five letter word is by guessing with 5 letter words. With the guesses the user provides, the game will return how many letters are in that word. You will continue guessing until you get the 5 letters, then you have to unscramble the letters to guess the word.

## Info & Rules:
- The Computer will select a random 5 letter word that contains all unique letters
- The User (you) will try to guess the 5 letter word by _USING_ 5 letter words
- The words that the User guess _CAN_ have non-unique letters but must be valid words
  - Example of valid guesses: `books`, `smart`, `apple`, `valid`
- You are allowed 8 guesses before having to guess the _FINAL_ word
- The Computer will warn you when you are down to 3 or less guesses
- Your guesses and the number of correct guesses will be shown
- If you can not guess the _FINAL_ word, then the Computer wins

### Have Fun & Good Luck!
